This is a place to store small projects I built so that I can have snippets and whatnot available.



wfcoffice: an implementation of wave function collapse which generates an office space, so far this is using only walls and desks but it seems to be working well. To run it make a virtual environment and install pillow (<py path> pip install pillow) then cd into wfcoffice and then run wave\_function\_collapse\_office.py which is found in wfcoffice.
